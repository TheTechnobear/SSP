# SSP release information 

# Unofficial SYNTHOR build


## the 'issue'
due to some incompatibilitis with modern build tools and juce.
the release version of SYNTHOR (13072022) is incompatible with my latest plugin build.
resulting in SYNTHOR crashing when the UI is accessed - see my dev blog on percussa forum for details.

I've discussed this with Percussa, and as a temporary workaround this, included is my build of SYNTHOR.


## how to use this version of SYNTHOR
this versions of SYNTHOR is : 
- unofficial and unsupported by Percussa
- functionally identical to the released version, just re-built

this means, if you wish to report bugs regarding **Synthor**, you must test against the RELEASED version of synthor.
therefore I would advise to keep a copy of this version before installing these plugins.

if you need to get a copy, then you can re-install from : 

[current SYNTHOR release](https://forum.percussa.com/t/update-13072022-superbooth-2022-sd-card-image-fixes-for-usb-audio-sample-rate-switching-asio-support/1556)



## the future
this is a temporary workaround. 
when a new version of synthor released, this will become redundant, and I will remove.
I do NOT have a timeframe for this, which is part of the reason for taking this step at this time.
